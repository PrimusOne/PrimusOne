### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**PrimusOne** is a DnD group i am a member of, and this is a repository to add the new things into the aurorabuilder,
that have been released by Wizards of the Coast.
Some of the things are homebrew, and some are official.

The "Goal" of this repository is to make it easier for me, and my group, to add things into the aurorabuilder.
Like for example new content updated subraces or items and such.
